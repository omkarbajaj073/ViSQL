# MySQL Wizard

### Objective
To create a GUI for users to interact with MySQL without the need for prior knowledge of the language. Given the widespread use of MySQL for backend data storage tasks and ease-of-use in seamless integration into applications, our project has great scope for development and expansion. At present, there exists no comprehensive, user-friendly GUI for interacting with SQL, thus, giving our project universal application. Database structure - designed at the discretion of the user.

### Tech Stack
Frontend - PyQt6
Backend - mysql.connector
