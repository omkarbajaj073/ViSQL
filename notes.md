1. When you switch between databases, need to remove the widget with the current database and replace it with the widget for the new database.

2. Things left to do: 

  Om: (Finish all layouts. Leave query functionality for later)
  - Logical where <strong>(Layout Done)</strong>, regex operator <strong>(Layout done)</strong>
  - Update table - <strong>(Layout Done)</strong>
  
  Query functions left - 
  - Constraints
  - Update (handle the data types)
  - Insert into table
  - Aggregate functions - (if time permits)
  
  Ant: 
  - Resizing - fields to match text length
  - Data integrity - try except around each query and print the error field.
  - Delete table
  - Delete rows
  
  
  - Styling (if time permits)
  - Help page to explain basic things like regex and all. (if time permits. Static page)
  - Logical or operator

  Not gonna do - 
  - Foreign key

3. Bugs - 
  - Constantly creating new pages instead of popping off the old widget
  - ManageTables - transitioning between layouts - new cursors are created. Do the old ones have to be closed or anything?
