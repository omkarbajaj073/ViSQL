1. When you switch between databases, need to remove the widget with the current database and replace it with the widget for the new database.

2. Things left to do: 

  - displays left - 
    - describe table
    - constraints (backlog)
    - help page (backlog)

  - Change titles of all opened dialogs (backlog)

  - Styling (backlog)
  

3. Inefficiencies - 
  - Constantly creating new pages instead of popping off the old widget
  - ManageTables - transitioning between layouts - new cursors are created. Do the old ones have to be closed or anything?  
  - importing * everywhere
