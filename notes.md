1. When you switch between databases, need to remove the widget with the current database and replace it with the widget for the new database.

2. Things left to do: 
  - Show log when db changed
  - Display constraints
  - Display group by result in table
  Query functions left - 
  - Extract table name box
  - Where clause queries - 
    - Delete rows - (Ant)
  - Insert into table (Ant)
  
  Ant: 
  - Resizing - fields to match text length
    - Partially accomplished
  - Delete rows
    - Layout DONE
    - Where clause TBD
    - Query TBD

  - Describe table (if time permits)
  - Natural join (if time permits)
  - Styling (if time permits)
  - Clean code for queries with  decorator (if time permits)
  - Help page to explain basic things like regex and all. (if time permits. Static page)

3. Bugs - 
  - Constantly creating new pages instead of popping off the old widget
  - ManageTables - transitioning between layouts - new cursors are created. Do the old ones have to be closed or anything?

4. Ideas
  - Input data type whenever you have to update something or add things to a list. (where clause in operator, update statements)
