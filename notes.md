1. When you switch between databases, need to remove the widget with the current database and replace it with the widget for the new database.

2. Things left to do: 

  Om: (Finish all layouts. Leave query functionality for later)
  - Where clause - formatting to query + layouts for logical and regex.
  - Logical where operator
  - Update table - Think about this once select is done. It's very similar.
  - Insert into table (There are a few Todos - format to a query)
  - Aggregate functions - (if time permits)
  
  
  Ant: 
  - Resizing - fields to match text length
  - Data integrity - try except around each query and print the error field.
  - Delete table
  - Delete rows
  
  
  - Styling (if time permits)
